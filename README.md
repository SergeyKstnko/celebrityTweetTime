# celebrityTweetTime

!!!To run the file you need to register your application on Twitter

This short program tries to answer the question: When to tweet to your favorite celebrity to increase your chance to get a response. It connects to twitter API and collects as many responses of that celebrity to other tweets. Then it draws histograms by day by hour.

I would love to hear any suggestiong to improve predictability of the script. Feel free to contact me or work on the script.


Still needs to be done:
1) Eliminate responses of the celebrity to his own tweets
2) Perform optimization (Most likely: substitute appending to a DataFrame for loading tweets into DataFrame directly)

Done
1) All dates are returned in UTC/GMT format
